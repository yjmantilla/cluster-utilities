**Killarney** is a cluster dedicated to the needs of the Canadian scientific Artificial Intelligence community. **Killarney** is located at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and is managed by the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and [SciNet](https://www.scinethpc.ca/). It is named after the [Killarney Ontario Provincial Park](https://www.ontarioparks.ca/park/killarney), located near Georgian Bay.

This cluster is part of the Pan-Canadian AI Compute Environment (PAICE).

## Site-specific policies

Killarney is currently open to Vector affiliated PIs with CCAI Chairs as well as researchers within an AI program at a Canadian university or applying AI methods for their research.

## Access

To access Killarney, each researcher must [request access in the CCDB](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_services).

Principal Investigators must be granted an AIP-type RAP (prefix `aip-` ) by their AI Institution, or by applying for [General Access to PAICE Systems](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/paice/general_access_to_paice_systems).

For the PI to sponsor researchers in their AIP RAP, the PI must:

- Go to the "Resource Allocation Projects" table on the CCDB Home page.
- Locate the RAPI of your AIP project (with the aip- prefix) and click on it to reach the RAP management page.
- At the bottom of the RAP management page, click on "Manage RAP memberships."
- Enter the CCRI of the user you want to add in the "Add Members" section.

To ensure the integrity and security of this resource, Vector enforces geo-blocking on Killarney as one of its cyber-security controls. Vector restricts access to and from countries identified in the [Government of Canada's Cyber Threat Assessment](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/national-cyber-threat-assessment-2025-2026).

## Storage system

**Killarney** 's storage system is an all-NVME VastData platform with a total usable capacity of 1.7PB.

| **Home space** | - Location of /home directories. - Each /home directory has a small fixed [quota](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Storage_and_file_management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies "Storage and file management"). - Larger requests go to the /project space. - Has daily backup |
| --- | --- |
| **Scratch space** | - For active or temporary (scratch) storage. - Large fixed [quota](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Storage_and_file_management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies "Storage and file management") per user. - Inactive data will be [purged](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Scratch_purging_policy "Scratch purging policy"). |
| **Project space** | - Large adjustable [quota](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Storage_and_file_management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies "Storage and file management") per project. - Has daily backup. |

## Network interconnects

Standard Compute nodes are interconnected with Infiniband HDR100 for 100Gbps throughput, while Performance Compute nodes are connected with 2 x HDR 200 for 400Gbps aggregate throughput.

## Scheduling

The **Killarney** cluster uses the Slurm scheduler to run user workloads. The basic scheduling commands are similar to the other national systems.

## Software

- Module-based software stack.
- Both the standard Alliance software stack as well as cluster-specific software.
