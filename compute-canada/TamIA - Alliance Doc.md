## TamIA

Availability: **March 31, 2025** Login node: **tamia.alliancecan.ca** [Automation node](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Automation_in_the_context_of_multifactor_authentication "Automation in the context of multifactor authentication"): robot.tamia.ecpia.ca Globus collection: [TamIA's Globus v5 Server](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=72c3bca0-9281-4742-b066-333ba0fdef72) Data transfer node (rsync, scp, sftp,...): **tamia.alliancecan.ca** Portal: [https://portail.tamia.ecpia.ca/](https://portail.tamia.ecpia.ca/)

tamIA is a cluster dedicated to artificial intelligence for the Canadian scientific community. Located at [Université Laval](http://www.ulaval.ca/), tamIA is co-managed with [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) and [Calcul Québec](https://calculquebec.ca/). The cluster is named for the [eastern chipmunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamias), a common species found in eastern North America.

tamIA is part of [\[1\]](https://www.alliancecan.ca/en/our-services/advanced-research-computing/pan-canadian-ai-compute-environment-paice), the Pan-Canadian AI Compute Environment\].

## Site-specific policies

- By policy, tamIA's compute nodes cannot access the internet. If you need an exception to this rule, contact [technical support](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Technical_support "Technical support") explaining what you need and why.
- `crontab` is not offered on tamIA.
- Please note that the **[VSCode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** is **forbidden** on the **login nodes** due to its heavy footprint. It is still authorized on the compute nodes.
- Each job should be at least one hour long (at least five minutes for test jobs) and you can't have more than 1000 jobs (running and pending) at the same time.
- The maximum duration of a job is one day (24 hours).
- Each job must use all 4 GPUs of the servers allocated, i.e. 4 with H100 and 8 with H200.

## Access

To access the cluster, each researcher must complete [an access request in the CCDB portal](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_services) under *Resources-->Artificial Intelligence-->tamIA*. Access to the cluster may take up to one hour after the access request is sent.  
You must then submit the [General Access to PAICE Systems](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/paice/general_access_to_paice_systems) declaration form.

Eligible principal investigators are members of an AIP-type RAP (prefix `aip-`).

The procedure for sponsoring other researchers is as follows:

- On the **[CCDB home page](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/)**, go to the *Resource Allocation Projects* table
- Look for the RAPI of the `aip-` project and click on it to be redirected to the RAP management page
- At the bottom of the RAP management page, click on **Manage RAP memberships**
- To add a new member, go to *Add Members* and enter the CCRI of the user you want to add.

The cluster can only be reached from Canada.

## Storage

| HOME   Lustre file system | - Location of home directories, each of which has a small fixed quota. - You should use the `project` space for larger storage needs. - Small per user [quota](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Storage_and_file_management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies "Storage and file management"). - There is currently no backup of the home directories. (ETA Spring 2026) |
| --- | --- |
| SCRATCH   Lustre file system | - Large space for storing temporary files during computations - No backup system in place - Large [quota](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Storage_and_file_management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies "Storage and file management") per user - There is an [automated purge](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Scratch_purging_policy "Scratch purging policy") of older files in this space. |
| PROJECT   Lustre file system | - This space is designed for sharing data among the members of a research group and for storing large amounts of data. - Large and adjustable per group [quota](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Storage_and_file_management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies "Storage and file management"). - There is currently no backup of the home directories. (ETA Summer 2025) |

For transferring data via [Globus](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Globus "Globus"), you should use the endpoint specified at the top of this page, while for tools like [rsync](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Transferring_data#Rsync "Transferring data") and [scp](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Transferring_data#SCP "Transferring data") you can use a login node.

## High-performance interconnect

The [InfiniBand](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_InfiniBand) [NVIDIA NDR](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/) network links together all of the nodes of the cluster. Each GPU is connected to a single NDR200 port through an NVIDIA ConnectX-7 HCA. Eeach GPU server has 4 or 8 NDR200 ports connected to the InfiniBand fabric.

The InfiniBand network is non-blocking for compute servers and is composed of two levels of switches in a fat-tree topology. Storage and compute nodes are connected via 4 or 8 400Gb/s connections to the network core.

## Node characteristics

| nodes | cores | available memory | CPU | storage | GPU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12 | 64 | 1024GB | 2 x [Intel Xeon Gold 6448Y 2,1 GHz, 32C](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/232384/intel-xeon-gold-6448y-processor-60m-cache-2-10-ghz/specifications.html) | 1 x 7.68TB SSD | 8 x [NVIDIA HGX H200](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h200/) SXM 141GB HBM3 700W, connected via NVLink |

### Software environments

[StdEnv/2023](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Standard_software_environments/fr "Standard software environments/fr") is the standard environment on tamIA.

### GPU jobs

Jobs are assigned on whole nodes with one of the following options:

For jobs on a node with an H100 GPU: `--gpus=h100:4`

For jobs on a node with an H200 GPU: `--gpus=h200:8`

For jobs using several GPUs, options are `--gpus-per-nodes=h100:4` or `--gpus-per-nodes=h200:8`.

## Monitoring jobs

From the tamIA [portal](https://portail.tamia.ecpia.ca/), you can monitor your jobs using CPUs and GPUs **in real time** or examine jobs that have run in the past. This can help you to optimize resource usage and shorten wait time in the queue.

You can monitor your usage of

- compute nodes,
- memory,
- GPU.

It is important that you use the allocated resources and to correct your requests when compute resources are less used or not used at all. For example, if you request 4 cores (CPUs) but use only one, you should adjust the script file accordingly.
