Availability: April 15, 2025 Login node: **vulcan.alliancecan.ca** Globus collection: [Vulcan Globus v5](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=97bda3da-a723-4dc0-ba7e-728f35183b43) System Status Page: [https://status.alliancecan.ca/system/Vulcan](https://status.alliancecan.ca/system/Vulcan) Portal: [https://portal.vulcan.alliancecan.ca](https://portal.vulcan.alliancecan.ca/)

**Vulcan** is a cluster dedicated to the needs of the Canadian scientific Artificial Intelligence community. **Vulcan** is located at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) and is managed by the University of Alberta and [Amii](https://amii.ca/). It is named after the town [Vulcan, AB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan,_Alberta), located in southern Alberta.

This cluster is part of the Pan-Canadian AI Compute Environment (PAICE).

## Site-specific policies

Internet access is not generally available from the compute nodes. A globally available Squid proxy is enabled by default with certain domains whitelisted. Contact [technical support](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Technical_support "Technical support") if you are not able to connect to a domain and we will evaluate whether it belongs on the whitelist.

Maximum duration of jobs is 7 days.

Vulcan is currently open to all researchers doing research on AI or applying AI methods in their research.

## Access

To be able to log in to Vulcan, you must [request access in CCDB](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_services).

To be able to submit jobs, you must be a member of an AIP RAP. If you are a PI and you do not already have one, apply for [General Access to PAICE Systems](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/paice/general_access_to_paice_systems).

If you are a PI and need to sponsor other researchers you will have to add them to your AIP RAP. Follow these steps to manage users:

- Go to the "Resource Allocation Projects" table on the [CCDB home page](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/).
- Locate the RAPI of your AIP project (with the `aip-` prefix) and click on it to reach the RAP management page.
- At the bottom of the RAP management page, click on "Manage RAP memberships."
- Enter the CCRI of the user you want to add in the "Add Members" section.

## Vulcan hardware specifications

| Nodes | Model | CPU | Cores | System Memory | GPUs per node | Total GPUs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 252 | Dell R760xa | 2 x Intel Xeon Gold 6448Y | 64 | 512 GB | 4 x NVIDIA L40s 48GB | 1008 |

## Storage system

**Vulcan** 's storage system uses a combination of NVMe flash and HDD storage running on the Dell PowerScale platform with a total usable capacity of approximately 5PB. Home, Scratch, and Project are on the same Dell PowerScale system.

| **Home space** | - Location of /home directories. - Each /home directory has a small fixed [quota](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Storage_and_file_management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies "Storage and file management"). - Not allocated via [RAS](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/accessing-resources/rapid-access-service) or [RAC](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/accessing-resources/resource-allocation-competition). Larger requests go to the /project space. - Has daily backup |
| --- | --- |
| **Scratch space** | - For active or temporary (scratch) storage. - Not allocated. - Large fixed [quota](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Storage_and_file_management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies "Storage and file management") per user. - Inactive data will be [purged](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Scratch_purging_policy "Scratch purging policy"). |
| **Project space** | - Large adjustable [quota](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Storage_and_file_management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies "Storage and file management") per project. - Has daily backup. |

## Network interconnects

Nodes are interconnected with 100Gbps Ethernet with RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) enabled.

## Scheduling

The **Vulcan** cluster uses the Slurm scheduler to run user workloads. The basic scheduling commands are similar to the other national systems.

## Software

- Module-based software stack.
- Both the standard Alliance software stack as well as cluster-specific software.
